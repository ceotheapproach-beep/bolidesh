    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction: Framing Human–Animal Relations</h2>
    <p>Human–animal relations in ancient India were not merely instrumental. They evolved into a complex, multi-dimensional coexistence that encompassed economic utility, social status, military capability and spiritual symbolism. As human societies developed, attitudes toward animals likewise changed: from prey and wild threats to assets in agriculture and transport, to military instruments, and eventually to cultural and religious symbols of reverence. This article examines the role of pets and domesticated animals from the Paleolithic through the Mauryan period — why certain animals were domesticated, how they contributed to agriculture and trade, their military uses, and their deep symbolic importance in local traditions and folklore. The analysis goes beyond a list of facts to reveal underlying cultural processes that granted animals a distinctive and often sacred place in ancient Indian societies.</p>

    <h2 id="paleolithic">Early Domestication: From Hunting to Herding (Paleolithic → Neolithic)</h2>
    <p>The earliest human economies were based on hunting and gathering. Rock art at sites such as Bhimbetka bears witness to human encounters with dangerous fauna and hunting scenes. Those images indicate lives oriented around obtaining food and surviving predation. Within that environment, humans gradually developed symbiotic relationships with certain wild species — a prolonged and incremental process of domestication and coexistence.</p>

    <h3>The Dog as First Domesticate</h3>
    <p>Archaeological evidence suggests that the dog was among the first animals domesticated by humans — with interactions dating back at least 15,000 years. Dogs provided practical services: tracking and retrieving prey, guarding camps, and serving as early companions. In return, humans provided food and shelter. This mutualistic relationship amplified hunting efficiency and improved safety.</p>

    <h3>Neolithic Herding: Sheep, Goats and Cattle</h3>
    <p>Roughly 11,000 years ago, alongside the agricultural revolution, humans began domesticating sheep, goats and cattle. This Neolithic transition from foraging to food production transformed human society: the emergence of permanent settlements, social stratification, and agricultural economies. Domesticated animals supplied milk, wool, hides and draft power, and enabled more stable food supplies and labour for fieldwork and transport.</p>

    <h2 id="indus">Indus Valley Civilization: Livestock in an Agrarian Economy</h2>
    <p>The Indus urban settlements represent a turning point where livestock became integral to an organized agrarian economy. Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro show evidence of cattle, buffalo, sheep, pigs and humped bulls. Buffaloes appear to have been especially important for dairy production and heavy agricultural tasks. Dogs and cats also appear in the archaeological record, indicating domestic roles and pest control.</p>

    <p>Draft animals—oxen and humped bulls—were used for ploughing, while donkeys and camels served as pack animals for long-distance trade. The presence of such animals demonstrates that Harappan communities relied on more than mere subsistence; they used animals to enhance productivity and commercial exchange.</p>

    <h3>The Horse Question</h3>
    <p>Scholars debate the presence and importance of horses in the Indus context. While some skeletal remains and terracotta figurines interpreted as horses exist at sites like Surkotada and Lothal, depictions of horses on seals and major Indus iconography are limited. This suggests horses may have been rare or their military role underdeveloped compared with later Vedic societies, where equine culture becomes central.</p>

    <h2 id="vedic">Vedic Period: Cattle, Horses and Social Prestige</h2>
    <p>In the Vedic period, wealth was often measured in terms of livestock—particularly cattle. The term <em>godhana</em> (literally “cattle wealth”) reflects how central cattle were to economy and status. Cows were valued for milk, ghee and dung, which were essential for subsistence as well as ritual life. Growing economic reliance on cattle contributed to their sanctification in social and religious norms.</p>

    <p>Horses assumed a prominent role in mobility, warfare and elite ritual. The horse’s importance is reflected in royal rituals such as the <em>ashvamedha</em> (horse sacrifice), which symbolized a king’s sovereignty and military prowess. Thus, an animal’s utilitarian worth could directly shape its cultural and ritual prestige.</p>

    <h3>Animal Sacrifice and Religious Tensions</h3>
    <p>Vedic texts document ritual animal sacrifice in certain contexts, but there are also voices within the tradition expressing restraint and ambivalence toward violence. Subsequent religious movements—particularly Buddhism and Jainism—emphasized nonviolence and compassion, influencing attitudes towards animals and leading to stronger ethical constraints against cruelty.</p>

    <h2 id="mauryan">Mauryan Period and After: State Patronage & Veterinary Science</h2>
    <p>The Mauryan era marks a phase where animal husbandry and veterinary care began to be administered at state level. Kautilya’s <em>Arthashastra</em> refers to organized livestock management and mentions officials responsible for cattle administration. The state invested in pasture management and created institutional arrangements that treated livestock as an economic resource to be governed.</p>

    <p>In military contexts, war elephants and cavalry were pivotal. Contemporary foreign accounts suggest the Mauryan state maintained large numbers of elephants and horse contingents, which enhanced battlefield capabilities and siegecraft. Veterinary literature also matured: works such as <em>Aśvayurveda</em> (on equine medicine) and <em>Hastayurveda</em> (on elephant medicine) indicate a professionalized concern for animal health and treatment.</p>

    <p>Following Ashoka’s turn to Buddhism, animal welfare and nonviolence gained prominence in state ideology. Some inscriptions and sources describe measures sympathetic to animals, and there are textual references to hospitals or care for animals — signs of evolving attitudes towards animal well-being.</p>

    <h2 id="symbolic">Cultural, Religious and Symbolic Roles of Animals</h2>
    <p>Across ancient Indian traditions, animals were woven into cosmology and ritual life. Many deities are associated with vahanas (vehicles) — animal figures that embody attributes of the gods and operate as powerful symbolic devices. For example, Ganesha’s mouse (mushika) symbolizes intelligence and the subjugation of base impulses; Durga’s lion signifies strength and courage; Sarasvati’s swan represents purity and discernment.</p>

    <p>Epic and mythological narratives also model ethical relations between humans and animals. Stories such as Yudhishthira’s refusal to ascend to heaven without his faithful dog in the <em>Mahabharata</em> underscore loyalty, duty and moral obligations toward animals. Such narratives serve to humanize animals and cast them as moral actors or companions rather than mere resources.</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion: Complexity and Continuity</h2>
    <p>The relationship between humans and animals in ancient India evolved from predation and pragmatic use to complex cultural integration. Over millennia, animals functioned as economic assets, instruments of military power, and symbols embedded in religious and social life. The trajectory—from Paleolithic hunters to Neolithic herders, from Indus agrarians to Vedic pastoralism and Mauryan statecraft—illustrates how animal roles shaped and were shaped by human social structures. These ancient patterns of respect, protection and symbolic incorporation continue to inform modern concerns about animal welfare and ecological balance, offering enduring lessons about coexistence.</p>
